## Problem
In a digital age where many industries have embraced digital and interactive layers, the automobile industry has lagged behind. While Web2 introduced social and personalization aspects to various sectors, the integration of Web3's financialization with gamification and community involvement is still a missing piece in the automotive world.

## MAZDA QUEST
Adding a Fun Layer to the Driving Experience
MAZDA QUEST aims to revolutionize the driving experience by leveraging Web3 technologies. It introduces the Mazda Token (MT), designed to reward drivers, passengers, and community members for engaging with their vehicles and the broader Mazda community.

## How It Works
**1. Dynamic NFT as Membership Cards**
Members will receive NFTs that evolve based on their driving habits and engagement levels, adding a personalized touch to the ownership experience.

**2. Earn MT Tokens**
2-1. Drive to Earn

**4. Open Ecosystem (Future Plan)**
The platform will evolve to allow anyone to create quests or rewards, further engaging the Mazda community.
Community members can craft their own quests or rewards on the Mazda Quest platform, fostering a dynamic, user-driven ecosystem.
